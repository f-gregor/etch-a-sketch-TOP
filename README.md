# **Etch-a-Sketch - The Odin Project**

In this assignment I am required to create a grid-like structure where individual tiles get colored in black on mouse hover events using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I also added events on mouseout in order to progressively fade back to white so that you can use the grid like a canvas to write letters and draw simple forms.
