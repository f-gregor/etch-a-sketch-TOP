# **Etch-a-Sketch - The Odin Project**

In this assignment I am required to create a grid-like structure where individual tiles gets randomly colored in response to mouse over events using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I decided to use hsl to randomly define the hue while keeping saturation and lightness constant to obtain only vibrant colors.
